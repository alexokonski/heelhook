Performance
===========

Throughput
----------

All 'Performance' tests in the autobahntestsuite were ran against a variety of
implementations. All tests were ran on a [linode 2GB](https://www.linode.com/pricing) running Ubuntu 14.04,
with both wstest and the implementation running on the same host. The steps
taken to set up each implementation were roughly the same as those found [here](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnTestSuite/tree/master/examples/publicreports)

The table below shows the sum total times of all tests ran. See the individual
reports generated by autobahn in the reports/ directory. Each test was run at
least 3 times, and the last run used in order to let any JITing have maximal
effectiveness.

|[websocketpp](http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp)                |48489|heelhook 3.45x faster|
|[ws](https://einaros.github.io/ws/)                              |16625|heelhook 1.18x faster|

Note that these tests are primarily a throughput test of the implementation,
not the ability to scale to N clients (though the the two may be related
depending on load).

Scalability

Coming Soon (tm)!!
